Introduction
============

``orbital_mechanics`` is a set of Python functions for various orbital mechanics calculations. It was created by `William Easdown Babb <https://github.com/weasdown/>`_.

Motivation
**********

I wanted to port some of the algorithms in *Fundamentals of Astrodynamics and Applications* to Python. This is to make them easy to use and to hopefully in future integrate them with my `GMAT API wrapper <https://github.com/weasdown/GMAT-Python-simple>`_.
